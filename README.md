Hi, I'm Yuri Basso! 

Data Science Student | Marketing Intern at @Bayer

I'm currently deepening my knowledge as a Data Science student at UNINTER and applying my skills as a Market Analyst Intern at Bayer, where I help the commercial team make data-driven strategic decisions.

At Bayer: My main responsibility is market analysis, sales tracking, and executing customer plans. Recently, a customer reach analysis I developed identified over 26,000 clients and their revenue for the 24/25 season, directly supporting the sales strategy.

I'm constantly exploring new tools and techniques in Data Science and Machine Learning.
